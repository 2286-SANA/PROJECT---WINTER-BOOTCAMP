# PROJECT---WINTER-BOOTCAMP

PROJECT 1--IMAGE PROCESSING
Hello 
this project is about IMAGE PROCESSING functions and we learn: 
-> Configure and run an opencv project in visual studio
-> Read and show images
-> Rotate the image

REQUIREMENTS:-
-> Opencv 
-> Visual Studio

PREREQUITIES:- 
Opencv and visual studio installed locally , depending upon OS

HOW TO RUN:-
starting with some basic image processing operations using opencv libraries in c++ programming language.
1-> must include opencv libraries in the first line of code: 
#include<opencv2/opencv.hpp>

2-> READ AND SHOW IMAGE 
for this we use iostream libraries and we should include it to code
ex-
#include<opencv2/opencv.hpp>
#include using namespace std; 
using namespace cv; 
void main() {...  }

hence, in this way project for image processing is made using opencv.

PROJECT 2--SUDUKO

A logic puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits in such a way such that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 grids that make up the larger 9x9 grid cointains all of the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.
Each Sudoku puzzle begins with some cells filled in. These numbers are chosen such that there is a unique solution to the sudoku
